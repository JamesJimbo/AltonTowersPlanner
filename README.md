# AltonTowersPlanner
A ride planner using the Queue-Times API to find the optimal route for each roller coaster and the ascending order for shortest times.

Simply run the exe file and you will be able to see all the major roller coasters (thrills) in Alton Towers and the optimal route, which uses
Dijktra's algorithm to optimise the waiting time. The route is ultimately up to the user but this can give you an idea how to plan
your journey at Alton Towers.
